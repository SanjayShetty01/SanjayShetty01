### Hello, I'm Sanjaya 👋

Passionate about crafting effective solutions, I'm an R Shiny Developer experienced in creating and maintaining applications for Pharma Analytics. Skilled in managing GitHub repositories and enhancing UI with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I thrive on optimizing R code for efficiency.

🌟 **Highlights:**
- Proficient in R, Python, Bash and Scala
- Adept with AWS, and seamless deployment
- Curious problem solver with a knack for optimizing code
- Racing enthusiast, always up for an F1 or WEC archive binge

🚀 **Technical Toolbox:**
R | Shiny | React | Flask | AWS | Scala | HTML | CSS | JavaScript

When I'm not at work or in denial about having a social life, I'm home watching F1 and WEC archives (The most played video being Kimi Räikkönen's 2005 Monaco Grand Prix Race), [Old] Top Gear, Grand Tour, and reading economic and financial reports.

Deep down, I'm just a curious, consistent, persistent person. It's an ideal quality if you plan on using Arch. (I use Arch, BTW XD)
